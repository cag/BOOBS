(.) BOOBS (.)
=============

A juicy input library for LOVE.
by your friend
 Alan Lu

== Quick-start guide ==
1. put boobs.update() in love.update somewhere
2. make movelists via <movelist identifier> = boobs.movelist:new("name me something unique!")
3. for each movelist you make, register sequences in them via <movelist identifier>:register_sequence(sequence, callback)
4. for each player you got, call <player var> = boobs.player:new()
5. bind joystick axes/hat/keys to directions with <player var>:bind_dir{ direction description }
6. bind buttons/keys to inputs with <player var>:bind_input(symbol, { input description })
7. if you want to flip the horizontal axis for a player, set <player var>.hflip = true

== X-TRA NOTES ==
reserved symbols for directions: l r u d lu ru ld rd
things are case sensitive unless you normalize your input
every input you bind produces press events (represented by the symbol you pass in) and release events (represented by symbol.."^")
sequence tokens, or symbols, are deliminated via whitespace
callbacks take one argument, the player index, and don't return anything
players are indexed in the order of their creation
hadoken is pretty much "d rd r p"

SEE: main.lua for an working example < this will probably be the most useful to look at

RECOMMENDED: use this together with a state machine if your sequences overlap to make character behavior consistent
